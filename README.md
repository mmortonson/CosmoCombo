## CosmoCombo

CosmoCombo is an interactive code for exploring constraints on 
cosmological models from combinations of data. The main features are:

- Read in chains of model parameters generated by Markov chain Monte Carlo 
  (MCMC).
- Use importance sampling to add prior probabilities and constraints from
  additional data sets.
- Compute basic statistics for model parameters (mean and median, 
  confidence intervals, etc.).
- Plot 1D and 2D projections of the probability distributions from 
  different combinations of data sets, and customize and 
  save the resulting plots.
- Save and restore previous sessions.

The main script is `CosmoCombo.py`. Running it will bring up a menu of options.
Usually the first step is to load an MCMC output file.
